# whileInput
General Description:
Write a program that gets an unspecified number of whole numbers from the user and displays the sum of the positive numbers entered and the product of the negative numbers entered. Use a while loop to control the number of iterations, ending the input when the user enters a 0.

In addition to displaying the sum of the positive numbers entered and the product of the negative numbers entered, you must display the number of positive and the number of negative values entered.

Use ints for all of your variables in the program.

Failure to follow the requirements for lab lessons can result in deductions to your points, even if you pass the validation tests. Logic errors, where you are not actually implementing the correct behavior, can result in reductions even if the test cases happen to return valid answers. This will be true for this and all future lab lessons.

Display Details
Make the output look like the following in your IDE. Recall that Zylabs uses preprogrammed inputs, so the values entered by the user and the newline generated when the user presses enter are not displayed in Zylabs. Do not forget to display a newline at the end of your output.
